My Awesome Project
I'm a Pikmin Bloom enthusiast and I created this site to allow people to share their awesome postcards in a easier to view way. This site also allows players to hold onto their most prized postcard images while being able to share them with their friends in game.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS
This is bad but I will refine later
Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

I created this app from frustration of losing my favorite postcards while sharing them in the bloom app because there is no way to hold onto the images without just screenshotting them and having them littered all over my photos in my phone. This is my first built fully functional website that I will ve working on for some time to make improvements and to bring in other players. I want to create a space to discuss, show off, and save wonderful moments of this game that many people are pasionate about. I used Node.JS on the server side and gave it my best to create an adaptable enviro0nment using the Module View Controller setup. I use cloudinary as an image holding site for the postcards and MongoDB for the server storage. Passport is currently in place for sign in authentication but it would be fun to try out using google auth instead just to get more experience applying them. 

Optimizations
(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
